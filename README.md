# Hackathon from University of Padua: Network Analysis of the Statistics Department of the University of Padua
In this hackathon we had the goal of making ***network analysis*** of university authors (teachers, research fellows, PhD students, professors emeritus and senior scholars) using data from their publications. So a teacher (node) was linked to another teacher (node) only if they have at least one publication in common.
To take these names (of the authors) and have the lists of publications we have to do *web scraping* in the various web pages.
The original file was in Italian and I translate all in English, so if there are some grammatical mistake it's for that (ðŸ˜‚).
My solution wa one of the best so I hope that this file can help you to improve you statistics/data scientist/coding skills.

This is the final output required at the hackathon (I know you don't see much of the names and nodes per se but it is exactly this graphical setup that has been requested of us):
